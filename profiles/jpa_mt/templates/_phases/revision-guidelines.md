# Revision Phase Guidelines

## Purpose

The revision phase corrects issues identified during code review. You must:

1. Read and understand all review feedback
2. Fix critical issues (these block approval)
3. Fix minor issues where identified
4. Maintain compliance with all standards

## Revision Process

1. **Analyze feedback** - Understand what needs to change
2. **Plan corrections** - Determine the minimal changes needed
3. **Apply fixes** - Make the corrections
4. **Verify** - Ensure the fix doesn't break other requirements

## Output Requirements

- Output corrected code using the same format as generation
- Only include files that were modified
- Each file must have the `// FILE: filename.java` marker
