## Planning Phase Guidelines

Your task is to create a comprehensive planning document by analyzing:
1. Schema structure (columns, constraints, relationships)
2. Standards requirements (base classes, conventions, patterns)
3. Multi-tenancy patterns (from schema analysis)

**You MUST:**
- Analyze, don't assume
- Ask questions about genuine ambiguities
- Document all design decisions
- Apply fallback rules when standards don't specify

**You MUST NOT:**
- Generate any code files
- Make assumptions beyond schema + standards + fallbacks
- Proceed to Phase 2 (code generation)
